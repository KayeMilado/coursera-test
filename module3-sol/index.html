			Rose
		</div>
		<p>
			A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears.
			
			There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.
			
			They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.
			
			Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.

			Tulips
		</div>
		<p>
			Tulips form a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes. 
			
			The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white. 
			
			They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the tepals, internally. 
			
			Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. 
			
			The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae. 
			
			There are about 75 species, and these are divided among four subgenera.

			Sunflower
		</div>
		<p>
			Helianthus AKA Sunflower is a genus of plants comprising about 70 species.
			
			Except for three species in South America, all Helianthus species are native to North America and Central America. 
			
			The common names "sunflower" and "common sunflower" typically refer to the popular annual species Helianthus annuus, whose round flower heads in combination with the ligules look like the sun.
			
			This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosus), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants.
			
			The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.
